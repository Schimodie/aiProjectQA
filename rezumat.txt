 HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put myreaders out of humour with themselves, with each other,with the season, or with me.  May it haunt their housespleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.Their faithful Friend and Servant,                                   C. D.December, 1843.CONTENTSStave   I: Marley's GhostStave  II: The First of the Three SpiritsStave III: The Second of the Three SpiritsStave  IV: The Last of the SpiritsStave   V: The End of ItSTAVE I:  MARLEY'S GHOSTMARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubtwhatever about that. The register of his burial wassigned by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: andScrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything hechose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as adoor-nail.Mind. I don't mean to say that I know, of myown knowledge, what there is particularly dead abouta door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, toregard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongeryin the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestorsis in the simile; and my unhallowed handsshall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. Youwill therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, thatMarley was as dead as a door-nail.Scrooge knew he was dead. Of course he did.How could it be otherwise. Scrooge and he werepartners for I don't know how many years. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfullycut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellentman of business on the very day of the funeral,and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back tothe point I started from. This must be distinctly understood, ornothing wonderful can come of the story I am goingto relate. If we were not perfectly convinced thatHamlet's Father died before the play began, therewould be nothing more remarkable in his taking astroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,than there would be in any other middle-agedgentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezyspot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehousedoor: Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to thebusiness called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,but he answered to both names. It was all thesame to him.Oh. Hard and sharp as flint,from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. Thecold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointednose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made hiseyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in hisgrating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on hiseyebrows, and his wiry chin. Foul weather didn'tknow where to have him. They often "came down"handsomely, and Scrooge never did.Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, withgladsome looks, "My dear Scrooge, how are you?When will you come to see me?" No beggars imploredhim to bestow a trifle, no children asked himwhat it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in allhis life inquired the way to such and such a place, ofScrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared toknow him; and when they saw him coming on, wouldtug their owners into doorways and up courts; andthen would wag their tails as though they said, "Noeye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!"But what did Scrooge care. It was the very thinghe liked. The city clocks hadonly just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had not been light all day--and candles were flaringin the windows of the neighbouring offices, likeruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fogcame pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and wasso dense without, that although the court was of thenarrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuringeverything, one might have thought that Naturelived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.The door of Scrooge's counting-house was openthat he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in adismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copyingletters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk'sfire was so very much smaller that it looked like onecoal. Whereforethe clerk put on his white comforter, and tried towarm himself at the candle; in which effort, not beinga man of a strong imagination, he failed."A merry Christmas, uncle. God save you!" crieda cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge'snephew, who came upon him so quickly that this wasthe first intimation he had of his approach."Bah!" said Scrooge, "Humbug!"He had so heated himself with rapid walking in thefog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he wasall in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; hiseyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again."Christmas a humbug, uncle!" said Scrooge'snephew. What's Christmastime to you but a time for paying bills withoutmoney; a time for finding yourself a year older, butnot an hour richer; a time for balancing your booksand having every item in 'em through a round dozenof months presented dead against you. And therefore,uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold orsilver in my pocket, I believe that it has done megood, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!"The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail sparkfor ever."Let me hear another sound from you," saidScrooge, "and you'll keep your Christmas by losingyour situation. He went the whole length of the expression,and said that he would see him in that extremity first."But why?" cried Scrooge's nephew. I'll retire to Bedlam."This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, hadlet two other people in. Scrooge,"said the gentleman, taking up a pen, "it is more thanusually desirable that we should make some slightprovision for the Poor and destitute, who suffergreatly at the present time. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (whichScrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstandinghis gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any placewith ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite asgracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possiblehe could have done in any lofty hall.And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had inshowing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poormen, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there hewent, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; andon the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stoppedto bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of historch.
