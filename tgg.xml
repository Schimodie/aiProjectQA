        <paragraph pageNumber="8">

          Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the
          summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans.
          And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely
          knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion
          overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping
          over sun-dials and brick walks and ning gardens finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright
          vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with
          reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his
          legs apart on the front porch.We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.I've finaly got a nice place here, he said, his eyes flashing about
          restlessly. We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosycolored space, fragilely bound into the house by French
          windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a
          little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,
          twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making
          a shadow on it as wind does on the sea. At this point Miss Baker said. Absolutely! with such
          suddenness that I started. It was the first word she uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as
          much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.
          I'm stiff,she complained, I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.
          Don't look at me, Daisy retorted. I've been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.
          No, thanks, said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, I'm absolutely in training.
          Her host looked at her incredulously. You are! He took down his drink as if it were a drop in
          the bottom of a glass. How you ever get anything done is beyond me. Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner
          was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as
          though he were moving a checker to another square. Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips
          the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered
          on the table in the diminished wind. Why CANDLES? objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers.
          They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was
          sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually
          disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself. You ought to live in California began Miss Baker but
          Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair. There was something pathetic in his concentration as if
          his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone
          rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.
          The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair
          and without a word went inside. I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a-of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn't he? She turned to Miss
          Baker for confirmation. An absolute rose? This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She
          was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed
          in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and
          went into the house. Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat
          up alertly and said - Sh! in a warning voice. Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the
          flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.
          Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being
          lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes.

          ‘Ten o’clock,’ she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. ‘Time for this good girl to go to bed.’
          ‘Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,’ explained Daisy, ‘over at Westchester.’
          ‘Oh,—you’re JORdan Baker.’ I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous
          expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her
          too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.
          ‘Good night,’ she said softly. ‘Wake me at eight, won’t you.’
          ‘If you’ll get up.’
          ‘I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.’

          The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge
          is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene
          for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was
          because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress. The fact that he had one was
          insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned
          up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting
          with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to meet her but
          I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by
          the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car.
          'We're getting off!' he insisted. 'I want you to meet my girl.' I think he'd tanked up a good
          deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. The
          supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do. I followed
          him over a low white washed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road
          under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of
          yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering
          to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent
          and another was an all night restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a
          garage Repairs. [...]Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish f
          igure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle
          thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women
          can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe de chine, contained no facet
          or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the
          nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her
          husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye.

          The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust covered wreck
          of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage
          must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the
          proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste.
          He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam
          of hope sprang into his light blue eyes. 'Hello, Wilson, old man,' said Tom, slapping him
          jovially on the shoulder. 'How's business?' 'I can't complain,' answered Wilson unconvincingly.
          'When are you going to sell me that car?' 'Next week; I've got my man working on it now.'
          'Works pretty slow, don't he?' 'No, he doesn't,' said Tom coldly. 'And if you feel that way
          about it, maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all.' 'I don't mean that,' explained
          Wilson quickly. 'I just meant  '

          Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away
          before she selected a new one, lavender colored with grey upholstery, and
          in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.
          But immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped
          on the front glass. 'I want to get one of those dogs,' she said earnestly.
          'I want to get one for the apartment. They're nice to have a dog.'We backed
          up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller.
          In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an
          indeterminate breed. 'What kind are they?' asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came
          to the taxi window. 'All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?' 'I'd like to get
          one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that kind?' The man peered
          doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by
          the back of the neck. 'That's no police dog,' said Tom. 'No, it's not exactly
          a police dog,' said the man with disappointment in his voice. 'It's more of
          an airedale.' He passed his hand over the brown wash rag of a back. 'Look at
          that coat. Some coat. That's a dog that'll never bother you with catching cold.'
          'I think it's cute,' said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. 'How much is it?' 'That
          dog?' He looked at it admiringly. 'That dog will cost you ten dollars.'The airedale
          undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were
          startlingly white changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she
          fondled the weather proof coat with rapture. 'Is it a boy or a girl?' she asked
          delicately. 'That dog? That dog's a boy.' 'It's a bitch,' said Tom decisively.
          'Here's your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.'

          'I'm going to have the McKees come up,' she announced as we rose in the elevator. 'And of course
          I got to call up my sister, too.' The apartment was on the top floor a small living room, a small
          dining room, a small bedroom and a bath.The living room was crowded to the doors with a set of
          tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually
          over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over enlarged
          photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance however the hen
          resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room.
          Several old copies of 'Town Tattle 'lay on the table together with a copy of 'Simon Called Peter'
          and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog.
          A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own
          initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuits one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer
          of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.
          I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that
          happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of
          cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there
          were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the drug store on the corner. When I came back they
          had disappeared so I sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of 'Simon Called Peter'
          either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things because it didn't make any sense to me.
          Just as Tom and Myrtle after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names
          reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door. The sister, Catherine, was a slender,
          worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white.
          Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature t
          oward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was
          an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with
          such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived
          here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with
          a girl friend at a hotel. Mr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. [..] 'I like your dress,'
          remarked Mrs. McKee, 'I think it's adorable.' Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in
          disdain. 'It's just a crazy old thing,' she said. 'I just slip it on sometimes when I don't care what I look
          like.' 'But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,' pursued Mrs. McKee. 'If Chester could only
          get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.' We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who
          removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded
          her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.
          'I should change the light,' he said after a moment. 'I'd like to bring out the modelling of the features.
          And I'd try to get hold of all the back hair.' 'I wouldn't think of changing the light,' cried Mrs. McKee.
          'I think it's  ' Her husband said 'SH!' and we all looked at the subject again whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned
          audibly and got to his feet. 'You McKees have something to drink,' he said. 'Get some more ice and mineral
          water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.' 'I told that boy about the ice.' Myrtle raised her eyebrows
          in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. 'These people! You have to keep after them all the time.'
          She looked at me and laughed pointlessly.  [...] She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.
          I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past. 'The only CRAZY I was was when I married him.
          I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never even told me about it,
          and the man came after it one day when he was out. She looked around to see who was listening: ' 'Oh, is that your
          suit?' I said. 'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to
          beat the band all afternoon.' 'She really ought to get away from him,' resumed Catherine to me. 'They've been living
          over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the first sweetie she ever had.' The bottle of whiskey a second one was
          now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine who 'felt just as good on nothing at all.'

          She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered.
          We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony
          to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were
          whispers about him from those who found little that it was
          necessary to whisper about in this world.
          The first supper there would be another one after midnight
          was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join
          her own party who were spread around a table on the other
          side of the garden. There were three married couples and
          Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent
          innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner
          or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a
          greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had
          preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the
          function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside
          East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully
          on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.
          Let's get out, whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful
          and inappropriate half hour. This is much too polite for
          me.We got up, and she explained that we were going to find
          the hostI had never met him, she said, and it was making
          me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy
          way.
          The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby
          was not there. She couldnt find him from the top of the
          steps, and he wasnt on the veranda. On a chance we tried
          an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic
          library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably
          transported complete from some ruin overseas.
          A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles
          was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great
          table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of
          books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined
          Jordan from head to foot.
          What do you think? he demanded impetuously.
          About what?
          He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.
          About that. As a matter of fact you neednt bother to ascertain.
          I ascertained. Theyre real.
          The books?
          He nodded.
          Absolutely realhave pages and everything. I thought
          theyd be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, theyre
          absolutely real. Pages andHere! Lemme show you.
          Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the
          bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard
          Lectures.
          See! he cried triumphantly. Its a bona fide piece of
          printed matter. It fooled me. This fellas a regular Belasco.
          Its a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew
          when to stop too didnt cut the pages. But what do you
          want? What do you expect?
          He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on
          its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole
          library was liable to collapse.
          Who brought you? he demanded. Or did you just come?
          I was brought. Most people were brought.
          Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.
          I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt, he continued.
          Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her
          somewhere last night. Ive been drunk for about a week now,
          and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.
          Has it?
          A little bit, I think. I cant tell yet. Ive only been here an
          hour. Did I tell you about the books? Theyre real. Theyre
          You told us.
          We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.

          I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table
          with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave
          way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter.
          I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls
          of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes
          into something significant, elemental and profound.
          At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and
          smiled.
          Your face is familiar, he said, politely. Werent you in
          the Third Division during the war?
          Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.
          I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen.
          I knew Id seen you somewhere before.
          We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages
          in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told
          me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to
          try it out in the morning.
          Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along
          the Sound.
          What time?
          Any time that suits you best.
          It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan
          looked around and smiled.
          Having a gay time now? she inquired.
          Much better. I turned again to my new acquaintance.
          This is an unusual party for me. I havent even seen the
          host. I live over there I waved my hand at the invisible
          hedge in the distance, and this man Gatsby sent over his
          chauffeur with an invitation.
          For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.
          Im Gatsby, he said suddenly.
          What! I exclaimed. Oh, I beg your pardon.
          I thought you knew, old sport. Im afraid Im not a very
          good host.
          He smiled understandingly much more than understandingly.
          It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of
          eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or
          five times in life. It faced or seemed to face the whole external
          world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU
          with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood
          you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed
          in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured
          you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your
          best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished
          and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a
          year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech
          just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced
          himself Id got a strong impression that he was picking his
          words with care.
          Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself
          a butler hurried toward him with the information that
          Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself
          with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
          If you want anything just ask for it, old sport, he urged
          me. Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.
          When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan
          constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected
          that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in
          his middle years.

          As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library
          opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together.
          He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his
          manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people
          approached him to say goodbye.
          Jordans party were calling impatiently to her from the
          porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.
          Ive just heard the most amazing thing, she whispered.
          How long were we in there?
          Why,about an hour.
          It was simply amazing, she repeated abstractedly. But
          I swore I wouldnt tell it and here I am tantalizing you. She
          yawned gracefully in my face. Please come and see me.
          Phone book. Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard.
          My aunt. She was hurrying off as she talked her
          brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her
          party at the door.
          Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed
          so late, I joined the last of Gatsbys guests who were clustered
          around him. I wanted to explain that Id hunted for
          him early in the evening and to apologize for not having
          known him in the garden.
          Dont mention it, he enjoined me eagerly. Dont give it
          another thought, old sport. The familiar expression held no
          more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed
          my shoulder. And dont forget were going up in the hydroplane
          tomorrow morning at nine oclock.
          Then the butler, behind his shoulder:
          Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.
          All right, in a minute. Tell them Ill be right there.
          good night.
          Good night.
          Good night. He smiled and suddenly there seemed
          to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last
          to go, as if he had desired it all the time. Good night, old
          sport. Good night.

          A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck
          and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the
          car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant,
          puzzled way.
          See! he explained. It went in the ditch.
          The fact was infinitely astonishing to him and I recognized
          first the unusual quality of wonder and then the
          man it was the late patron of Gatsbys library.
          Howd it happen?

          I know nothing whatever about mechanics, he said decisively.
          But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?
          Dont ask me, said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the
          whole matter. I know very little about driving next to
          nothing. It happened, and thats all I know.
          Well, if youre a poor driver you oughtnt to try driving
          at night.
          But I wasnt even trying, he explained indignantly, I
          wasnt even trying.
          An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
          Do you want to commit suicide?
          Youre lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not
          even TRYing!
          You dont understand, explained the criminal. I wasnt
          driving. Theres another man in the car.
          The shock that followed this declaration found voice in
          a sustained Ah-h-h! as the door of the coup swung slowly
          open. The crowd it was now a crowd stepped back involuntarily
          and when the door had opened wide there was
          a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale
          dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively
          at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
          Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by
          the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood
          swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the
          duster.
          Whas matter? he inquired calmly. Did we run outa
          gas?
          Look!
          Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel he
          stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though
          he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.
          It came off, some one explained.
          He nodded.
          At first I din notice wed stopped.
          A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening
          his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice:
          Wonderff tell me where theres a gasline station?
          At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than
          he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer
          joined by any physical bond.
          Back out, he suggested after a moment. Put her in reverse.
          But the WHEELS off!
          He hesitated.
          No harm in trying, he said.

          It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is
          a thing you never blame deeply I was casually sorry, and
          then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a
          curious conversation about driving a car. It started because
          she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked
          a button on one mans coat.
          Youre a rotten driver, I protested. Either you ought to
          be more careful or you oughtnt to drive at all.
          I am careful.
          No, youre not.
          Well, other people are, she said lightly.
          Whats that got to do with it?
          Theyll keep out of my way, she insisted. It takes two to
          make an accident.
          Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.
          I hope I never will, she answered. I hate careless people.

         He saw me looking with admiration at his car.
‘It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport.’ He jumped off to give me a 
better view. ‘Haven’t you ever seen it before?’I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes  and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town.
I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the 
past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had 
little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person 
of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and 
he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door.
And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t 
reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his 
elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit.
‘Look here, old sport,’ he broke out surprisingly. ‘What’s 
your opinion of me, anyhow?’
A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions 
which that question deserves.
‘Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,’ 
he interrupted. ‘I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me 
from all these stories you hear.’ So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored 
conversation in his halls.
‘I’ll tell you God’s truth.’ His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. ‘I am the son of some 
wealthy people in the middle-west—all dead now. I was 
brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all 
my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is 
a family tradition. 
He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker 
had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase ‘educated at Oxford,’ or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had 
bothered him before. And with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn’t something 
a little sinister about him after all.

            ‘I’m going to make a big request of you today,’ he said,pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, ‘so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying 
to forget the sad thing that happened to me.’ He hesitated.
‘You’ll hear about it this afternoon.’
‘At lunch?’
‘No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re 
taking Miss Baker to tea.’
‘Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?’
‘No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.’
I hadn’t the faintest idea what ‘this matter’ was, but I was 
more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea 
in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request 
would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment I 
was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.
    
            He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting 
vitality as we went by.
With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through 
half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars 
of the elevated I heard the familiar ‘jug—jug—SPAT!’ of a 
motor cycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.
‘All right, old sport,’ called Gatsby. We slowed down.
Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the 
man’s eyes.
‘Right you are,’ agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. 
‘Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!’
‘What was that?’ I inquired. ‘The picture of Oxford?’
‘I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he 
sends me a Christmas card every year.’
Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the 
girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, 
with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and 
sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the 
city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.
A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, 
followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more 
cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us 
with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-eastern 
Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid 
car was included in their somber holiday. As we crossed 
Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white 
chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks 
and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs 
rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.
‘Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this 
bridge,’ I thought; ‘anything at all….’
Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.

            Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.
‘Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.’
A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in 
either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in 
the half darkness.
‘—so I took one look at him—’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, ‘—and what do you think I did?’
‘What?’ I inquired politely.
But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped 
my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.
‘I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, ‘All right, 
Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ 
He shut it then and there.’
Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward 
into the restaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a 
new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.
‘Highballs?’ asked the head waiter.
‘This is a nice restaurant here,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. ‘But I like 
across the street better!’
‘Yes, highballs,’ agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: ‘It’s too hot over there.’
‘Hot and small—yes,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, ‘but full of 
memories.’

          When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o'clock
          and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating
          glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.
          At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into 'hide-and-go-seek' or 'sardines-inthe-
          box' with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in the trees which blew the
          wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I
          saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.

          I went in-after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stove-but I don't believe they
          heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked
          or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I came
          in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby
          that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated
          from him and filled the little room.
          'Oh, hello, old sport,' he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake
          hands.
          'It's stopped raining.'
          'Has it?' When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled
          like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. 'What do you think of that?
          It's stopped raining.'
          'I'm glad, Jay.' Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.
          'I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,' he said, 'I'd like to show her around.'
          'You're sure you want me to come?'
          'Absolutely, old sport.'
          Daisy went upstairs to wash her face-too late I thought with humiliation of my towels-while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.
          'My house looks well, doesn't it?' he demanded. 'See how the whole front of it catches the light.'
          I agreed that it was splendid.
          'Yes.' His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. 'It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.'
          'I thought you inherited your money.'
          'I did, old sport,' he said automatically, 'but I lost most of it in the big panic-the panic of the war.'
          I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered 'That's my
          affair,' before he realized that it wasn't the appropriate reply.
          'Oh, I've been in several things,' he corrected himself. 'I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business.
          But I'm not in either one now.' He looked at me with more attention. 'Do you mean you've been thinking over what I proposed the other night?'
          Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.
          'That huge place THERE?' she cried pointing.
          'Do you like it?'
          'I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone.'
          'I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.'
          Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting
          murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the
          sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-atthe-
          gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no
          sound but bird voices in the trees.

    		About this time an ambitious young reporter from New
    York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked
    him if he had anything to say.
    ‘Anything to say about what?’ inquired Gatsby politely.
    ‘Why,—any statement to give out.’
    It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man
    had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection
    which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand.
    This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried
    out ‘to see.’
    It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was
    right. Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who
    had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on
    his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short
    of being news. Contemporary legends such as the ‘underground
    pipe-line to Canada’ attached themselves to him,
    and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a
    house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was
    moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just
    why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James
    Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say.

    	James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name.
    He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific
    moment that witnessed the beginning of his career—when 
    he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious
    flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been
    loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey
    and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby
    who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE
    and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break
    him up in half an hour.
    I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even
    then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—
    his imagination had never really accepted them as
    his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West
    Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of
    himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means
    anything, means just that—and he must be about His
    Father’s Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious
    beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that
    a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to
    this conception he was faithful to the end.
    For over a year he had been beating his way along the
    south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon
    fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and
    bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through
    the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days. He knew
    women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous
    of them, of young virgins because they were
    ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about
    things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took
    for granted.
    But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most
    grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at
    night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in
    his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the
    moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the
    floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until
    drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an
    oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an
    outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of
    the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world
    was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.
    An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some
    months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in
    southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed
    at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to
    destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which
    he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake
    Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on
    the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows
    along shore.
    Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada
    silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-
    five. The transactions in Montana copper that made
    him many times a millionaire found him physically robust
    but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this
    an infinite number of women tried to separate him from
    his money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella
    Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon
    to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were
    common knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902. He
    Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 107
    had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five
    years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny at Little
    Girl Bay.
    To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up
    at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and
    glamor in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody—he had
    probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled.
    At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them
    elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick,
    and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him
    to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck
    trousers and a yachting cap. And when the TUOLOMEE
    left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left
    too.He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while
    he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper,
    secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew
    what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about
    and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more
    and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years
    during which the boat went three times around the continent.
    It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact
    that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a
    week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.
    ....
    And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy
    of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never
    understood the legal device that was used against him
    but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.
    He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the
    vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality
    of a man.

    For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the

    They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a

    my car. Excuse me for just a minute.’
    The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and
    the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.
    ‘My God, I believe the man’s coming,’ said Tom. ‘Doesn’t
    he know she doesn’t want him?’
    ‘She says she does want him.’
    ‘She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul
    there.’ He frowned. ‘I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy.
    By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women
    run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all
    kinds of crazy fish.’
    Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps
    and mounted their horses.
    ‘Come on,’ said Mr. Sloane to Tom, ‘we’re late. We’ve
    got to go.’ And then to me: ‘Tell him we couldn’t wait, will
    you?’
    Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool
    nod and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing
    under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light
    overcoat in hand came out the front door.
    Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around
    alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her
    to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening
    its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my
    memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There
    were the same people, or at least the same sort of people,
    the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored,
    many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the
    air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before.

          It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest
          that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday
          night-and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio
          was over.
          Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles
          which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a
          minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were
          sick I went over to find out-an unfamiliar butler with a villainous
          face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.
          'Is Mr. Gatsby sick?'
          'Nope.' After a pause he added 'sir' in a dilatory, grudging
          way.
          'I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell
          him Mr. Carraway came over.'
          'Who?' he demanded rudely.
          'Carraway.'
          'Carraway. All right, I'll tell him.' Abruptly he slammed
          the door.
          My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every
          servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with
          half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village
          to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies
          over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the
          kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the
          village was that the new people weren't servants at all.

        The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the
        warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the
        tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National
        Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The
        straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;
        the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into
        her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened
        under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a
        desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.
        'Oh, my!' she gasped.
        I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to
        her, holding it at arm's length and by the extreme tip of the
        corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it-but every
        one near by, including the woman, suspected me just
        the same.
        'Hot!' said the conductor to familiar faces. 'Some weather!
        Hot! Hot! Hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it
        ... ?' My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark
        stain from his hand. That any one should care in this heat
        whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the
        pajama pocket over his heart!

        We were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware
        of it, we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J.
        Eckleburg's faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered
        Gatsby's caution about gasoline.
        'We've got enough to get us to town,' said Tom.
        'But there's a garage right here,' objected Jordan. 'I don't
        want to get stalled in this baking heat.'
        Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an
        abrupt dusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the
        proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment
        and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.
        'Let's have some gas!' cried Tom roughly. 'What do you
        think we stopped for-to admire the view?'
        'I'm sick,' said Wilson without moving. 'I been sick all
        day.'
        'What's the matter?'
        'I'm all run down.'
        'Well, shall I help myself?' Tom demanded. 'You sounded
        well enough on the phone.'
        With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the
        doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the
        tank. In the sunlight his face was green.
        'I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch,' he said. 'But I
        need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were
        going to do with your old car.'
        'How do you like this one?' inquired Tom. 'I bought it
        last week.'
        'It's a nice yellow one,' said Wilson, as he strained at the
        handle.
        'Like to buy it?'
        'Big chance,' Wilson smiled faintly. 'No, but I could make
        some money on the other.'
        'What do you want money for, all of a sudden?'
        'I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and
        I want to go west.'
        'Your wife does!' exclaimed Tom, startled.
        'She's been talking about it for ten years.' He rested for
        a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. 'And now
        she's going whether she wants to or not. I'm going to get
        her away.'
        The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the
        flash of a waving hand.
        'What do I owe you?' demanded Tom harshly.
        'I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,'
        remarked Wilson. 'That's why I want to get away. That's why
        I been bothering you about the car.'
        'What do I owe you?'
        'Dollar twenty.'
        The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse
        me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so
        far his suspicions hadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered
        that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in
        another world and the shock had made him physically sick.
        I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel
        discovery less than an hour before-and it occurred to me
        that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or
        race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the
        well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably
        guilty-as if he had just got some poor girl with child.
        'I'll let you have that car,' said Tom. 'I'll send it over tomorrow
        afternoon.'
        That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in
        the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as
        though I had been warned of something behind. Over the
        ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their
        vigil but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were
        regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty
        feet away.
        In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had
        been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering
        down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no con
        down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no con
        sciousness of being observed and one emotion after another
        crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.
        Her expression was curiously familiar-it was an
        expression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle
        Wilson's face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until
        I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed
        not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his
        wife.
        The word 'sensuous' had the effect of further disquieting
        Tom but before he could invent a protest the coupe came to
        a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.
        'Where are we going?' she cried.
        'How about the movies?'
        'It's so hot,' she complained. 'You go. We'll ride around
        and meet you after.' With an effort her wit rose faintly

        A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her
        hands and shouting; before he could move from his door
        the business was over.
        The 'death car' as the newspapers called it, didn't stop;
        it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically
        for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend.
        Michaelis wasn't even sure of its color-he told the first policeman
        that it was light green. The other car, the one going
        toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond,
        and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life
        violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her
        thick, dark blood with the dust.
        Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they
        had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration,
        they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap
        and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The
        mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though
        she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality
        she had stored so long.
        We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd
        when we were still some distance away.
        'Wreck!' said Tom. 'That's good. Wilson'll have a little
        business at last.'
        He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping
        until, as we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the
        people at the garage door made him automatically put on
        the brakes.
        'We'll take a look,' he said doubtfully, 'just a look.'
        I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued
        incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got
        out of the coupe and walked toward the door resolved itself
        into the words 'Oh, my God!' uttered over and over in
        a gasping moan.
        'There's some bad trouble here,' said Tom excitedly.
        He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of
        heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light
        in a swinging wire basket overhead. Then he made a harsh
        sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement
        of his powerful arms pushed his way through.
        The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation;
        it was a minute before I could see anything at
        all. Then new arrivals disarranged the line and Jordan and I
        were pushed suddenly inside.
        Myrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then
        in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in
        the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and Tom,
        with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next
        to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names
        with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I
        couldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that
        echoed clamorously through the bare garage-then I saw
        Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying
        back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both
        hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and
        attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder,
        but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop
        slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall
        and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly
        his high horrible call.
        'There was two cars,' said Michaelis, 'one comin', one

        I couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between 
grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams. Toward 
dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive and immediately 
I jumped out of bed and began to dress-I felt that I had 
something to tell him, something to warn him about and 
morning would be too late.
Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open 
and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with 
dejection or sleep.
'Nothing happened,' he said wanly. 'I waited, and about 
four o'clock she came to the window and stood there for a 
minute and then turned out the light.'
His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did 
that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions 
and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light 
switches-once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the 
keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount 
of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though 
they hadn't been aired for many days. I found the humidor 
on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside. 
Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room 
we sat smoking out into the darkness.

        I didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent
stroke of work but it was more than that-I didn't want to
leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I
could get myself away. 'I'll call you up,' I said finally.
'Do, old sport.'
'I'll call you about noon.'
We walked slowly down the steps.
'I suppose Daisy'll call too.' He looked at me anxiously as
if he hoped I'd corroborate this.
'I suppose so.'
'Well-goodbye.'
We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached
the hedge I remembered something and turned around. I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking
him for that-I and the others.
'Goodbye,' I called. 'I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.'
Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations
on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in
my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me and I
started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was
Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because
the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and
clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other
way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something
fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come
sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed
harsh and dry.

         His movements-he was on foot all the time-were afterward
traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad's Hill
where he bought a sandwich that he didn't eat and a cup
of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly for
he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was
no difficulty in accounting for his time-there were boys
who had seen a man 'acting sort of crazy' and motorists at
whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for
three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the
strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he 'had a way of
finding out,' supposed that he spent that time going from
garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On
the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came
forward-and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding
out what he wanted to know. By half past two he was
in West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsby's
house. So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.
At two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be
brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a
pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the
summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he
gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out
under any circumstances-and this was strange because
the front right fender needed repair.
Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool.
Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur
asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a
moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.
No telephone message arrived but the butler went without
his sleep and waited for it until four o'clock-until long
after there was any one to give it to if it came. I have an idea
that Gatsby himself didn't believe it would come and perhaps
he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt
that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for
living too long with a single dream. He must have looked
up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and
shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and
how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A
new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts,
breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about ... like
that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the
amorphous trees.
The chauffeur-he was one of Wolfshiem's proteges-
heard the shots-afterward he could only say that he hadn't
thought anything much about them. I drove from the station
directly to Gatsby's house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one.
But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word
said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried
down to the pool.
There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the
water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward
the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly
the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly
down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated
the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course
with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves
revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red
circle in the water.
It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that
the gardener saw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass,
and the holocaust was complete.

            After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that  night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police  and photographers and newspaper men in and out of  Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys  soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and  there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed  about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps  a detective, used the expression 'mad man' as he bent over  Wilson's body that afternoon, and the adventitious Nickity  of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next  morning.

            Most of those reports were a nightmare-grotesque, circumstantial,  eager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony  at the inquest brought to light Wilson's suspicions of his wife  I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy  pasquinade-but Catherine, who might have said anything,  didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of character  about it too-looked at the coroner with determined  eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her  sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely  happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no  mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it and cried  into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man  'deranged by grief' in order that the case might remain in  its simplest form. And it rested there.

            But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I
            found myself on Gatsby's side, and alone. From the moment
            I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village,
            every surmise about him, and every practical question, was
            referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then,
            as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or speak
            hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because
            no one else was interested-interested, I mean, with
            that intense personal interest to which every one has some
            vague right at the end.
            I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called
            her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom
            had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with
            them.
            'Left no address?'
            'No.'
            'Say when they'd be back?'
            'No.'
            'Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?'
            'I don't know. Can't say.'
            I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into
            the room where he lay and reassure him: 'I'll get somebody
            for you, Gatsby. Don't worry. Just trust me and I'll get somebody
            for you--'
            Meyer Wolfshiem's name wasn't in the phone book. The
            butler gave me his office address on Broadway and I called
            Information, but by the time I had the number it was long
            after five and no one answered the phone.
            'Will you ring again?'
            'I've rung them three times.'
            'It's very important.'
            'Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there.'
            I went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant
            that they were chance visitors, all these official people
            who suddenly filled it. But as they drew back the sheet and
            looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued
            in my brain.
            'Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me.
            You've got to try hard. I can't go through this alone.'
            Some one started to ask me questions but I broke away
            and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked
            parts of his desk-he'd never told me definitely that his parents
            were dead. But there was nothing-only the picture of
            Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from
            the wall.

            Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter
            to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him
            to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous
            when I wrote it. I was sure he'd start when he saw the
            newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire from Daisy
            before noon-but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived,
            no one arrived except more police and photographers and
            newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem's
            answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity
            between Gatsby and me against them all.
            Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible
            shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true
            at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all
            think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very
            important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing
            now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a
            letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about
            a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.
            Yours truly
            MEYER WOLFSHIEM
            and then hasty addenda beneath:
            Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at

            I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed
            Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said
            only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone
            the funeral until he came.
            It was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless
            and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against
            the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with
            excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his
            hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey
            beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was
            on the point of collapse so I took him into the music room
            and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat.
            But he wouldn't eat and the glass of milk spilled from his
            trembling hand.
            'I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,' he said. 'It was all in
            the Chicago newspaper. I started right away.'
            'I didn't know how to reach you.'
            His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the
            room.
            'It was a mad man,' he said. 'He must have been mad.'
            'Wouldn't you like some coffee?' I urged him.
            'I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.--'
            'Carraway.'
            'Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?'
            I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and
            left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps
            and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had
            arrived they went reluctantly away.
            After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came
            out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking
            isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age
            where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise,
            and when he looked around him now for the first time and
            saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great rooms
            opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be
            mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs;
            while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all
            arrangements had been deferred until he came.
            'I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby--'
            'Gatz is my name.'
            '-Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body
            west.'
            He shook his head.
            'Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his
            position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.-?'
            'We were close friends.'
            'He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a
            young man but he had a lot of brain power here.'
            He touched his head impressively and I nodded.
            'If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like
            James J. Hill. He'd of helped build up the country.'
            'That's true,' I said, uncomfortably.
            He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it
            from the bed, and lay down stiffly-was instantly asleep.

        That night an obviously frightened person called up
        and demanded to know who I was before he would give his
        name.
        'This is Mr. Carraway,' I said.
        'Oh-' He sounded relieved. 'This is Klipspringer.'
        I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another
        friend at Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers
        and draw a sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few
        people myself. They were hard to find.
        'The funeral's tomorrow,' I said. 'Three o'clock, here at
        the house. I wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested.'
        'Oh, I will,' he broke out hastily. 'Of course I'm not likely
        to see anybody, but if I do.'
        His tone made me suspicious.
        'Of course you'll be there yourself.'
        'Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is--'
        'Wait a minute,' I interrupted. 'How about saying you'll
        come?'
        'Well, the fact is-the truth of the matter is that I'm staying
        with some people up here in Greenwich and they rather
        expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact there's a sort
        of picnic or something. Of course I'll do my very best to get
        away.'
        I ejaculated an unrestrained 'Huh!' and he must have
        heard me for he went on nervously:
        'What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I
        wonder if it'd be too much trouble to have the butler send
        them on. You see they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless
        without them. My address is care of B. F.--'
        I didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the
        receiver.
        After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby-one gentleman
        to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what
        he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was one of
        those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage
        of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known better than
        to call him.

        <paragraph pageNumber="181">
            The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see
            Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn't seem to reach him any other
            way. The door that I pushed open on the advice of an elevator
            boy was marked 'The Swastika Holding Company' and
            at first there didn't seem to be any one inside. But when I'd
            shouted 'Hello' several times in vain an argument broke out
            behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared
            at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile
            eyes.
            'Nobody's in,' she said. 'Mr. Wolfshiem's gone to Chicago.'
            The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone
            had begun to whistle 'The Rosary,' tunelessly, inside.
            'Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.'
            'I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?'
            At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem's called
            'Stella!' from the other side of the door.
            'Leave your name on the desk,' she said quickly. 'I'll give
            it to him when he gets back.'
            'But I know he's there.'
            She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands
            indignantly up and down her hips.
            'You young men think you can force your way in here any
            time,' she scolded. 'We're getting sickantired of it. When I
            say he's in Chicago, he's in ChiCAgo.'
            I mentioned Gatsby.
            'Oh-h!' She looked at me over again. 'Will you just-
            what was your name?'
            She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly
            in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me
            into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad
            time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.
            'My memory goes back to when I first met him,' he said.
            'A young major just out of the army and covered over with
            medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep
            on wearing his uniform because he couldn't buy some regular
            clothes. First time I saw him was when he come into
            Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked
            for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come
            on have some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four
            dollars' worth of food in half an hour.'
            'Did you start him in business?' I inquired.
            'Start him! I made him.'
            'Oh.'
            'I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I
            saw right away he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young
            man, and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew I
            could use him good. I got him to join up in the American
            Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did
            some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so
            thick like that in everything-' He held up two bulbous fingers
            '-always together.'
            I wondered if this partnership had included the World's
            Series transaction in 1919.
            'Now he's dead,' I said after a moment. 'You were his
            closest friend, so I know you'll want to come to his funeral
            this afternoon.'
            'I'd like to come.'
            'Well, come then.'
            The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook
            his head his eyes filled with tears.
            'I can't do it-I can't get mixed up in it,' he said.
            'There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now.'
            'When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in
            it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was
            different-if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck
            with them to the end. You may think that's sentimental but
            I mean it-to the bitter end.'
            I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined
            not to come, so I stood up.
            'Are you a college man?' he inquired suddenly.
            For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a 'gonnegtion'
            but he only nodded and shook my hand.
            'Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is
            alive and not after he is dead,' he suggested. 'After that my
            own rule is to let everything alone.'

        <paragraph pageNumber="183">
            When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got
            back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I
            went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down
            excitedly in the hall. His pride in his son and in his son's
            possessions was continually increasing and now he had
            something to show me.
            'Jimmy sent me this picture.' He took out his wallet with
            trembling fingers. 'Look there.'
            It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners
            and dirty with many hands. He pointed out every detail to
            me eagerly. 'Look there!' and then sought admiration from
            my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think it was more
            real to him now than the house itself.
            'Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It
            shows up well.'
            'Very well. Had you seen him lately?'
            'He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the
            house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run
            off from home but I see now there was a reason for it. He
            knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he
            made a success he was very generous with me.'
            He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for
            another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned
            the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old
            copy of a book called 'Hopalong Cassidy.'
            'Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It
            just shows you.'
            He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for
            me to see. On the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE,
            and the date September 12th, 1906. And underneath:
            Rise from bed     . 6.00 A.M.
            Dumbbell exercise and wall-scaling   6.15-6.30 A.M.
            Study electricity, etc     7.15-8.15 A.M.
            Work        8.30-4.30 P.M.
            Baseball and sports    . 4.30-5.00 P.M.
            Practice elocution, poise and how to attain it 5.00-6.00 P.M.
            Study needed inventions   . . 7.00-9.00 P.M.
            GENERAL RESOLVES
            No wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]
            No more smokeing or chewing
            Bath every other day
            Read one improving book or magazine per week
            Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week
            Be better to parents
            'I come across this book by accident,' said the old man. 'It
            just shows you, don't it?'
            'It just shows you.'
            'Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves
            like this or something. Do you notice what he's got
            about improving his mind? He was always great for that. He
            told me I et like a hog once and I beat him for it.'
            He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item
            aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use.

            A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from
            Flushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windows
            for other cars. So did Gatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his
            eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a
            worried uncertain way. The minister glanced several times
            at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait for
            half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.
            About five o'clock our procession of three cars reached
            the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the
            gate-first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr.
            Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and, a little
            later, four or five servants and the postman from West Egg
            in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started
            through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and
            then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy
            ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed
            glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby's books
            in the library one night three months before.
            I'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew
            about the funeral or even his name. The rain poured down
            his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see
            the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby's grave.
            I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he
            was already too far away and I could only remember, without
            resentment, that Daisy hadn't sent a message or a flower.
            Dimly I heard someone murmur 'Blessed are the dead that
            the rain falls on,' and then the owl-eyed man said 'Amen to
            that,' in a brave voice.
            We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars.
            Owl-Eyes spoke to me by the gate.
            'I couldn't get to the house,' he remarked.
            'Neither could anybody else.'
            'Go on!' He started. 'Why, my God! they used to go there
            by the hundreds.'
            He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and
            in.
            'The poor son-of-a-bitch,' he said.

            One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west
            from prep school and later from college at Christmas time.
            Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the
            old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a December evening
            with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own
            holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the
            fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and
            the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead
            as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings
            of invitations: 'Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'?
            the Schultzes'?' and the long green tickets clasped tight in
            our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the
            Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad looking cheerful
            as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.
            When we pulled out into the winter night and the real
            snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle
            against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin
            stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into
            the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back
            from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware
            of our identity with this country for one strange hour before
            we melted indistinguishably into it again.
            That's my middle west-not the wheat or the prairies or
            the lost Swede towns but the thrilling, returning trains of
            my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty
            dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted
            windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with
            the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing
            up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are
            still called through decades by a family's name. I see now
            that this has been a story of the West, after all-Tom and
            Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and
            perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which
            made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.
            Even when the East excited me most, even when I was
            most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling,
            swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable
            inquisitions which spared only the children and the very
            old-even then it had always for me a quality of distortion.
            West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic
            dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred
            houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching
            under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In
            the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking
            along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken
            woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles
            over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men
            turn in at a house-the wrong house. But no one knows the
            woman's name, and no one cares.

            After Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like
            that, distorted beyond my eyes' power of correction. So
            when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and
            the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to
            come back home.
            There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward,
            unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been
            let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just
            trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse
            away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what
            had happened to us together and what had happened afterward
            to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big
            chair.
            She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking
            she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little,
            jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the
            same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When
            I had finished she told me without comment that she was
            engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were
            several she could have married at a nod of her head but I
            pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if
            I wasn't making a mistake, then I thought it all over again
            quickly and got up to say goodbye.
            'Nevertheless you did throw me over,' said Jordan suddenly.
            'You threw me over on the telephone. I don't give a
            damn about you now but it was a new experience for me
            and I felt a little dizzy for a while.'
            We shook hands.
            'Oh, and do you remember-' she added, '--a conversation
            we had once about driving a car?'
            'Why-not exactly.'
            'You said a bad driver was only safe until she met an
            other bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn't I?
            I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I
            thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person.
            I thought it was your secret pride.'
            'I'm thirty,' I said. 'I'm five years too old to lie to myself
            and call it honor.'
            She didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and
            tremendously sorry, I turned away.

        <paragraph pageNumber="194">
            One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He
            was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert,
            aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to
            fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and
            there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up
            to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning
            into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me
            and walked back holding out his hand.
            'What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands
            with me?'
            'Yes. You know what I think of you.'
            'You're crazy, Nick,' he said quickly. 'Crazy as hell. I don't
            know what's the matter with you.'
            'Tom,' I inquired, 'what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?'
            He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed
            right about those missing hours. I started to turn away but
            he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.
            'I told him the truth,' he said. 'He came to the door while
            we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word
            that we weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was
            crazy enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the
            car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute
            he was in the house--' He broke off defiantly. 'What if I
            did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw
            dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a
            tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and
            never even stopped his car.'
            There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable
            fact that it wasn't true.
            'And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering-
            look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that
            damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat
            down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful--'
            I couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what
            he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very
            careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and
            Daisy-they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated
            back into their money or their vast carelessness or
            whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people
            clean up the mess they had made.
            I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt
            suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went
            into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace-or perhaps
            only a pair of cuff buttons-rid of my provincial squeamishness
            forever.
            Gatsby's house was still empty when I left-the grass on
            his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers
            in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate
            without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps
            it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the
            night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about
            it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him
            when I got off the train.

        <paragraph pageNumber="12">
            I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those
            gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly
            that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and
            incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down
            his drive. One night I did hear a material car there and saw
            its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't investigate.
            Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the
            ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.
            On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold
            to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent
            failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene
            word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out
            clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe
            raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the
            beach and sprawled out on the sand.
            Most of the big shore places were closed now and there
            were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of
            a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher
            the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I
            became aware of the old island here that flowered once for
            Dutch sailors' eyes-a fresh, green breast of the new world.
            Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's
            house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and
            greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted
            moment man must have held his breath in the presence of
            this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation
            he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last
            time in history with something commensurate to his capacity
            for wonder.
            And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world,
            I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the
            green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long
            way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so
            close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know
            that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast
            obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic
            rolled on under the night.
            Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future
            that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but
            that's no matter-tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out
            our arms farther. And one fine morning--
            So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back
            ceaselessly into the past.
            THE END
